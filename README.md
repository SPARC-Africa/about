## What is SPARC Africa

[SPARC](https://sparcopen.org) is the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition. SPARC Africa is the African Chapter of SPARC.

The exponential increase in the cost of access to information has led to the coming together of research institutes, academic institutions, funding bodies and the public to challenge this phenomenon. The steep rise in subscription costs on the back of decreasing subscription budgets, which is already totally inadequate in African institutions of higher education, demand a new approach to acquiring access information to support African research.

Acknowledging that there are a myriad of factors influencing low research output emanating from Africa, the lack of access to information is viewed as a significant challenge negating African research production. The lack of access to scholarly information by African researchers continues to confirm Africa as a net consumer of the world’s knowledge production; Africa has been relegated to the periphery of the world’s knowledge production. Research production by African researchers is
debilitated by this lack of access to information.

Exacerbating the African scenario is the fact that African research conducted by African and non-African researchers are published in North American and European journals; these journals, in the main, are not accessible to Africans due to severe financial constraints. In an era of a glut of information, Africa is in the paradoxical situation of having to cope with a dearth of information. The chase for the maximum profit margins by major publishing houses demand the emergence of new scholarly communication models that will level the scholarly information landscape and contribute to the emergence of Africa as a new role player in world knowledge production. 

In search of an alternative publishing model, the African information seeking communities subscribes to the founding principles of SPARC (USA), SPARC (Europe) and other SPARC entities.
